Growing up, I was the farthest thing from a computer wizard. I was a full-fledged bunhead: a pre-professional ballerina. I would run from school every day to make my 4 o'clock ballet class. On my free-time, (and that was a rare occurence, considering how time-consuming my ballet classes were,) I would watch movies, visit museums, go to concerts. I loved and appreciated fine art, and all types of performing art.

I was also, howvever, an enthusaistic academic student, who especially excelled in math and science. I loved using the logical part of my brain to break down problems. I loved finding creative ways to find solutions. I saw anything I didn't understand as not only a challenge, but an opportunity. So when my fellow bunheads started to get homeschooled to devote more time to ballet, I didn't. I enjoyed going to school, as much as I loved ballet.

Many years laters, here I am, and I have to say the right and left sides of my brain, figuratively-speaking, are still pursuing their own, seperate passions. I devoted most of my time after college to become an actor and filmmaker. To this day, my favorite pastimes include going to plays, art galleries, museums. And though I don't dance ballet professionally, I love a good dancefloor session.

Lately however, in the past couple years, I have been craving a different kind of knowledge, outside the performing arts. I miss the excitment that solving a math or chemistry problem would give me.  But I knew  I did not quite want to become a mathemecian or chemist. An idea finally hit me when a friend of mine who works for a big tech company commented "It's funny, I can so see you working at my office... your personality is so suited for it. I like you on my team." That's when I had an A-HA moment. I had a flashblack to (very) basic coding that I taught myself growing up. I still have a fond memory of showing my webpage to my friends. I started to looking into coding, and then software engineering. 

Software engineering to me is a way to combine the two sides of my brain that are eager to be used: the problem-solving side, and the creative, social side. I love that software engineering provides a platform to exercise so many different skills, and that it is a field that is constantly moving and shaking. There is and always will be something new to solve and something newer to learn.
