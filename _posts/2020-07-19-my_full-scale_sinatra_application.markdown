For our second project at the Flatiron School, we were asked to make a full-scale Sinatra application. The main requirement was that it had to have a database, and we would need to use Active Record. We learned about the Model-View-Controller organization, and I felt comfortable with it. However, I wanted to organize myself before my project when it came to the simple usage of my app. What would a user use my app for? And how would they navigate it?

I decided to create a Logbook called "How'd It Go? that would help a user keep track of past interactions. Let's say a user was frequenting networking events, this application would help a user keep track of the people they met, the experience they had, and when and where the event(s) took place. They would need to create an account in order to use the app. This way, I could use validations to make sure that another user wasn't creating, editing, or deleting their information. After signing up, a user would be able to create, edit, delete and view their entries. They'd also ofcourse, be able to log out. Here is a very simple diagram that I made:

This diagram helped navigate my app before I even made it. Even though I visit sites everyday, creating an app meant that I would have to walk through a normal user experience, and a lot of times, we take this organization for granted. When I started to make my application, I refered to my diagram often, to make sure I was creating the user-friendly experience that I wanted, and that a user could navigate my app with familiarity and ease.
